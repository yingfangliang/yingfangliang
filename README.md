### Bonjour, it's Ying-Fang! :relaxed:

#### I'm a Master of Analytics student at McGill with 3 years of professional experience at Qualcomm as an engineer. :woman_technologist:
<br>
I've been working on production efficiency improvement in various industries including semiconductor, aerospace, and apparel fabric. I'm fascinated by finding the logical structure behind real-world issues and getting to the bottom of it to resolve the problems. Knowing and witnessing how data analytics could change the game, I decided to pause my career in Taiwan and explore more in this field here in Montreal (and experience -30°C winter :snowman_with_snow: and noice summer ☀️).
